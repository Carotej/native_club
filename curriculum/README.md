# METHODOLOGY
The proposal has 8 modules; each one will be done in one session. Each session will be held every 15 days. The sessions will be personal, face to face. We will also have other tools to interact virtually: slack and a channel in Telegram. 

For each session there will be:

* Introduction to the meeting through dynamic and participatory activities (Games, body workout, yoga, among others.)
* Topic presentation
* Development of the topic by a tutor or subject specialist.
* All learnings are developed through exercises, quoting some tutors: "learn by doing".
* A volunteer is responsible for making a report (reflection, note, thought) in any format (audio, video and text) on each session.

In the first session they are going to raise group objectives, such as making an eBook with the work done, having a blog where they upload the contents, news and advances, among other ideas.

For the communication, an email account is managed and also a group in Telegram where they will share contents, questions will be asked and will be the channel of communication of the participants.
 
 
# EVALUATION

At each session participants will complete a survey with questions such as: What did I like? What would I improve? Do the topics learned help to problems in my community? How would you share what youâ€™ve learned in your community?

The tutor will also have to make an assessment in terms of knowledge, methodologies, if the objectives were achieved and what activities he recommends to improve the experiences to come.
