## The web can speak in indigenous languages!

# 1. DESCRIPTION
The Internet has revolutionized the world generating a significant change in the way people communicate, create, interact. 
 
However, the educational system in Latin America has not integrated into its formal educational system a web literacy model to teach key digital skills, and access to digital skills training is even worse for indigenous communities.

* “250 millions of latin americans remain unconnected.
* rural areas lack of an infrastructure to access the Internet.
* the majority of the people who are disconnected think that access is whether too expensive or/and useless.
* language skills are a major barrier to adoption
* only one of every three people use Internet”

Latin America is a multilingual region with hundreds of indigenous languages that are still spoken. Around 40 million people in the region speak an indigenous language, and for many this is their mother tongue, however these are underrepresented on the Internet (Spanish is one of them). 

There is an overwhelming need to promote online content and services in indigenous languages as part of digital inclusion policies in the region.

Despite the efforts made by some governments and NGO’s  the rate of adoption and usage in rural areas is not the same as in urban areas. Besides infrastructure there is a huge gap in the education system. There is no training in topics such as information, communication, content creation, online privacy and security..
 
At present time in Latin America there is a digital activism movement in which indigenous languages are promoted and used as a way to resist the disappearance of languages and cultures, we have for the case the network of digital activists of Indigenous Languages. The Internet could be a place where we preserve and teach these languages and continue to share the culture.

From the experience with many activists, discussions and meetings, it can be concluded that it is definitely necessary to promote a culture of learning and collaboration also in the network. 

Education is the key to support different initiatives that are being developed, to build other spaces for collaboration and creation. In this sense the objective of this proposal is to encourage other forms of organization, other spaces for participation, learning and cooperation.
 
This proposal aims to be an introduction to digital literacy [1] for people belonging to indigenous communities. It is about promoting digital literacy through a proposal conceived from a participatory perspective and inclusion, where the learning, use and participation of the internet are key.

# 2. GOALS
## Regarding participants
* Make participants feel valued, respected, with a clear sense of contribution to a larger movement.
* Generate a space where people can learn basic tools so they can start generating content in their own languages.
* Consolidate a group of open web leaders who feel empowered to foster the movement within their communities.

## Regarding communities
* Build a sustainable community that promotes digital inclusion.
* Encourage spaces for communication, discussion and collaboration.
* Encourage the training of all implicit persons, as a key to better teaching and learning practices.
* Create social and economic opportunities for new digital users and the community at large 

## Regarding The Open Web Movement - Mozilla
* To advance processes of web literacy and digital inclusion within aboriginal communities in Latin America, which are underrepresented and excluded by their own governments. 
* Understand steps to creating a healthier internet locally in Colombia that is shared and open
* Receive ideas to enrich their proposals and strategies.
* Get some of their tools and content localized into indigenous languages. 

# 3. PARTICIPANTS
The following proposal has been designed as a pilot to be launched in Mexico and Colombia. 

In Mexico according to Ethnologue, 289 languages are spoken, 281 are indigenous languages and 4 are non-indigenous languages. All the indigenous languages spoken in the country are in different degrees of threat, so the majority-speaking languages displace the others. The Internet is a potential tool to balance this situation in addition to giving other social status to languages. In the future, it is hoped to consolidate groups for speakers of indigenous languages in different Latin American countries (in most countries indigenous communities are present) such as Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Guatemala and Brazil.

The pilot project will be developed in Oaxaca-Mexico, Guatemala -Guatemala, Leticia-Colombia, Quito-Ecuador and Cuzco-Perú. 

According to focus groups, participants will have different ages, levels of study and also experience in the use of technological tools. We will have four other nodes

There has been some interaction with these communities in which they have expressed their interest in having spaces for learning and building the digital world. Likewise, some of the meetings will be face-to-face but there will be also spaces for digital interaction through tools such as Telegram, mailing lists and videoconferences.
